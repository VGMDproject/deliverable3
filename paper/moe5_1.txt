The sustainability and nonconformism of conferences as premier publication venues in computer science is the subject of intense debate. Evaluating scientists for promotion and budget allocation involves metrics like journal impact factors and h-indexes based on citation counts retrieved from Scopus and the Web of Science (WoS). Many computer scientists view the historical focus of these databases on journals as a professional disadvantage, even though many conferences have been included in Scopus since 2004 and WoS since September 2008, including older ones entered later. Inclusion of proceedings and journals in Scopus and WoS is often viewed as a stamp of approval and relevance. Complementing coverage studies, this article explores the inaccuracy of citation records, along with their effect on the perceived impact of CS conferences and on author ranking. ACM, Scopus and WoS must develop better reference-parsing technology to fix the significant undercitation in their databases.
