The shortage of women in computer science (CS) is well documented. Since 2001, the Computing Research Association Taulbee Survey reports the percentage of women obtaining a bachelor's degree in CS dropped from 18.8% in 2001 to 13.8% in 2010. Harvey Mudd College (HMC) is recognized for dramatically increasing the percentage (and number) of women majoring in CS, from 12% historically to approximately 40%, where it has held steady since 2008. This percentage is well above the US average, even among elite private schools, which, at approximately 16%, tend to have a slightly higher average than elite public schools. The National Center for Women & Information Technology provides information on dozens of practices, large and small, that have been shown to support recruitment and/or retention of women in CS.
