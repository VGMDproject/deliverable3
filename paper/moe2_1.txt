n this column, the authors present results from two studies on the domestic research pipeline carried out by CRA-E, the Education Committee of the Computing Research Association. The first study examined the baccalaureate origins of domestic Ph.D. recipients; the second study analyzed applications, acceptances, and matriculation rates to 14 doctoral programs. Informed by findings from these studies, they also present recommendations they believe can strengthen the domestic Ph.D. pipeline. Master's institutions and departments awarding Ph.D.'s produce approximately an equal number of computer science bachelor's degrees. But the number of applications accepted for admission at Ph.D. programs ranked 5-10 from students who received their bachelor's from research universities was over 24 times higher than for students from master's institutions. The analogous ratio for the 11+ consumer departments was 4.5. The findings indicate some large graduate schools have forged productive partnerships with colleges and smaller universities in their regions.
