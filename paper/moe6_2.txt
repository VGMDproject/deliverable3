 Enrollment in computer science classes in the US has increased for the first time in six years, according to the Computing Research Association's (CRA'S) annual Taulbee Survey. Total enrollment by majors and pre-majors in computer science is up 6.2% per department over last year. The upward surge of student interest is real and bigger than anyone expected, says Peter Lee, incoming chair of CRA. The average number of new students per department majoring in computer science is up 9.5% over last year.
