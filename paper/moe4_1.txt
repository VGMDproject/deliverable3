The number of postdoctoral researchers in computer science slightly more than doubled in the decade ending in 2008. It is troubling that the number has doubled again in the subsequent three years. This changes the demographics of the academic computing research enterprise, in particular. Most graduate departments primarily train Ph.D. students for a tenure-track faculty position in a research institution, though there is now some diversity in career path training in some universities. The Taulbee statistics document that most graduates will not achieve an academic tenure-track position. A mere 7% of graduates were hired directly into tenure-track faculty positions in 2011. Teaching faculty and research faculty have roughly stayed constant. Biomedical sciences have gotten very badly out of balance with respect to the number of postdocs and the long delay before they, on average, take permanent positions.
