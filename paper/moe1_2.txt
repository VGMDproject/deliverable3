The Simons Foundation, a New York City-based private foundation devoted to advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences, recently named 13 mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and theoretical computer scientists as recipients of its Simons Investigator awards. Simons Investigator awards provide "extraordinary researchers" with long-term support to investigate the most fundamental issues in their fields, according to the foundation. Simons Investigators are appointed for five years, with possible renewal for another five years.
