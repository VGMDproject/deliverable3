Not long ago, the educational crisis most talked about by computer scientists was the steep decline in the number of undergraduates who picked the field as their major. Today, with those declines in reverse at many US universities, there is a growing recognition -- both in the US and internationally -- that the real crisis lies not at the college level, but in primary and secondary school. Over the past 20 years the percentage of students who take computer science in US high schools has dropped from 25% to 19%. In many schools, the subject is simply not taught. Fitting computer science into the curriculum is a particular problem in the US, where each state defines its own academic standards. Yet even as curricula improve, a larger challenge looms for international computer science education: attracting qualified teachers and keeping them abreast of new developments in a fast-changing field.
